    In this post, we want to bring you up to speed on what is happening inside Steemit, as well as give you our perspective on the successes (and failures) of the past year, let you know what we see as our mission going forward, and provide some insight into what we have planned.

    <h1>Steemit’s Vision and Mission</h1>

    Through our vision of **empowering entrepreneurs to tokenize the internet**, our primary roles in the Steem ecosystem are providing the community with software enhancements to the Steem blockchain, modular framework applications made up of components that can be leveraged by application developers and inspiration through these platforms to entrepreneurial end-users. We believe we must build in ways that create as many opportunities — and catalyze as many amazing Steem-based entrepreneurs and communities — as possible.`;

<p><b>Everybody has a dream. Most of the time it takes us a while to turn these great wishes into reality, especially   because they usually come with a bigger     price tag.</b></p>
<p>Now thanks to Steem some of us will be able to cut corners in order to achieve their goals more quickly. The additional income can be a game changer to many players.</p>
<p>My Steem earnings enabled me to buy a piece of land where I'll build my first own house. Writing down these words still seems a bit unreal to me, since I didn't believe to come to that point so quickly.</p>

<p>Without hard work and dedication as well as the great support from the community this wouldn't have been possible. Also the timing was brilliant, I joined in the earlier stages.</p>
<p><b>I'm both grateful and proud.</b></p>
<p>Many people supported me along the way, some tried to tear me down. I'm glad I only stayed with those who pushed me, they have a large stake in my success story.</p></html>`;
